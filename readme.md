# Base16 Theme for alot

This is a Base16 theme for the terminal mail client [alot](https://github.com/pazz/alot).

It uses the terminal colors supplied by [base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell).
This means there is no template;
the theme will work as is for all themes that are applied with `base16-shell`.

Only the 256 color space versions work at the moment.
Supporting the 16 color space themes would be as simple as ensuring the `b0*`
variables are assigned the correct colors.
